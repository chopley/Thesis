I could not just terminate the inputs to Tray 2 as this does not have sufficient power to get into dynamic range of the spectrum analyser.

So instead I've input the same power (namely Ch1 from Tray 1) into all of the Channels- Note there is a 3dB+20dB pad on Ch1 output- All the measurements are done on the full 1GHz IF band but after the splitter- LO is at 15dBm 4.5GHz from sig gen

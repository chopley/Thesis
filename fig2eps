# Converts a .fig file into an .eps file suitable for including              #
# in a latex document via, say, the graphicx package.                         #
#                                                                             #
# This program typesets any latex commands (as "specially flagged" text)      #
# within foo.fig                                                              #

# The argument of this program is the name of                                 #
# a fig file "foo.fig", or simply "foo"                                       #

# The probgram looks for an optional file foo.preamble in the same            #
# directory as foo.fig, where additional                                      #
# latex preamble commands such as "\newcommand{\es}{\emptyset}" can be placed.#

\section{Notch Filters}
\subsection{Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)}

Unfortunately, as the survey has progressed, we have become increasingly beset
by terrestrial, satellite and aircraft interference (see Figure~\ref{fig:intensity}). Aircraft interference is
sporadic enough in nature to flag out, but satellite and terrestrial interference is, however, more troublesome (see \fign{fig:intensity}). The effect on the data is noticeable up to 50$^{\circ}$ elevation, making post-measurement removal very difficult, if not impossible.

 To remedy this on the Northern receiver, we designed a set of narrowband notch filters (to reduce the effect of in-band RFI) and also increased the out-of band attenuation, by adding a second stage of band-defining filters. The resulting change of the passband can be seen in \fign{fig:passbands}. The effect on data quality (\fign{fig:intensityFiltering}) is noticeable and, with the 0.25s/pixel integration period used to produce these scans, RFI is no longer noticeable.

Details of the filter design is included in Section~\ref{sec:filterDesign}

\subsection{Filter Design}
\label{sec:filterDesign}
\subsection{Specifications}
The in-band RFI (\fign{fig:RFImaxHold}) is narrow band. Designing a notch filter to remove these signals requires a high quality factor (Q factor) ($Q=\frac{f_{c}}{\Delta f}$) design. A cursory examination of Figure~\ref{fig:RFImaxHold} suggests that each RFI band is approximately 25~MHz wide, which at 5~GHz requires a Q factor of 200. This is a challenging task, and can only realistically be achieved using superconducting filters, since most of the degradation in quality factor at this level is caused by resistive losses. Unfortunately, the timescales we were operating on did not permit a thorough exploration of superconducting filter options.

However upon more careful examination of Figure~\ref{fig:RFImaxHold}, it is clear that some relaxation of this requirement is possible, without significantly degrading the passband. Each of the major RFI bands (i.e 4.92~GHz and 5.18~GHz) has a second proximate RFI peak, which could be included into a single notch filter. To attenuate both of these a stop band of ~80~MHz is required (i.e Q factor of 63). This is an achievable goal on standard Copper printed circuit board, provided the copper is cooled to reduce resistive losses.

\subsection{Design}

High Q filter design using microstrip, is usually accomplished using resonance structures placed parallel to a microstrip transmission line, with electromagnetic coupling between the two. The dimensions of these structures can be adjusted to resonate at the frequency of interest. Alternatively band pass filters can be constructed in a similar fashion by placing these resonating structures in series with the transmission line.

Since this was our first foray into the world of resonance filter designs we looked for a simple resonating structure which would be easy to 'tune'. The design we chose (\cite{splitRingClassic} )is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:squareRingResonator}.

 \label{fig:squareRingResonator}
\end{figure}

We used these resonators to design 3 initial filters for 4.65~GHz, 4.70~GHz and 4.75~GHz. This allowed us to check that the filter behaved as the simulations predicted across a small range of frequencies.

We see the additional feature ~10\% higher in frequency caused by the error in manufacture (see Figure~\ref{fig:4_65GHzFilter}) in all three of the designs. We also see that the central notch behaves as we expect although they are approximately 50~MHz lower than the simulations predict}
 \label{fig:MeasuredResults}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\subsection{Cooling the Filters}

We expected the filter bandwidth to improve at lower temperatures, since most of the loss was resistive loss in the Copper. To test this we initially cooled the design with liquid nitrogen, however we found that the liquid nitrogen effected the central response by changing the dielectric constant of the region directly above the resonator structures.

We decided then to conduct the test in the Oxford test cryostat and achieved the results in \fign{fig:coolingResponse}.

\subsection{Filter Installation at Owens Valley Antenna}

The RFI notch filters were installed at the Owens Valley antenna on the 7~May~2011 (see \fign{fig:cryostatInstall}). The filters have successfully suppressed the RFI shown in \fign{fig:RFImaxHold}. The transmission through the cryostat can be seen in \fign{fig:cryostatTransmission}.

%   Future work has included manufacturing filters appropriate to mitigating the Owens Valley RFI seen in Figure~\ref{fig:RFImaxHold}. An image of one of these can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:newDesign}.

All have several variations in the central frequency to allow the best version to be selected. It should be noted that I have a little concern about the effect that we will see when we have the first and last resonators so close to the box wall. Simulations don't suggest any issues, but tests still need to be conducted to be sure. }

\subsection{Other Possibilities}

High temperature superconducting filters \cite{splitRingHTS}, would achieve much higher Q values, allowing us to design filters for each of the RFI features. However the manufacture process is complicated, and in addition would be a new method for the Physics department. We are however currently pursuing this, and should have preliminary results in the next few weeks.

The other possibility is to switch over to a digital polarimeter. There would be some time delay in getting this implemented and working, however it would synergise efforts when rolling out the South African antenna.

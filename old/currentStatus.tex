\section{Status Summary}

\subsection{Northern Hemisphere Survey}

The OVRO antenna design and installation has been completed with a similar design expected for the Southern Hemisphere antenna. The complete antenna is shown in \fign{fig:ovroTelescope}. We have currently agreed on a commissioning process, and are working towards completing this.






\subsection{Southern Hemisphere Survey}
Construction has begun on the secondary reflector. A new digital receiver will be used on the South African antenna (see Section~\ref{sec:digitalImplementation}). The digital design is complete, and we are currently sourcing the front end analog receiver components. The South African antenna is ready to begin observations after we install the complete system in September of 2010.

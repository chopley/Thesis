\section{Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)}

Unfortunately, as the survey has progressed, we have been increasingly beset by terrestrial, satellite and aircraft interference (see Figure~\ref{fig:intensity}). Aircraft interference is sporadic enough in nature to flag out, but satellite and terrestrial interference is, however, more troublesome (see \fign{fig:intensity}). The effect on the data is noticeable up to 50$^{\circ}$ elevation, making post-measurement removal very difficult, if not impossible.

The RFI consists of both in band and out of band signals. Different approaches have been adopted to deal with them. We have designed a set of appropriately narrow band notch filters to deal with the in-band RFI (see \appen{sec:filterDesign} for details), and have cascaded an additional set of the original bandpass filters to combat out of band RFI.

 The resulting change of the passband can be seen in \fign{fig:passbands}. The effect on data quality (\fign{fig:intensityFiltering}) is noticeable with the 0.25s/pixel integration period used to produce these scans.
